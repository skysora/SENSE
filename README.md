## ðŸ“– Introduction
Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) play a crucial role in disaster risk reduction. Traditionally, single-station models have been widely used, but they often fail to consider global information across multiple seismic stations, leading to limitations in performance. 

In this study, we propose **SENSE**, a deep-learning-based framework that integrates multistation information to enhance earthquake intensity predictions. By leveraging self-attention mechanisms, SENSE captures both local station characteristics and broader regional seismic patterns. Our results, evaluated on datasets from **Taiwan and Japan**, demonstrate that SENSE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in early warning accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Multistation Data Integration**: Utilizes information from multiple seismic stations instead of relying on a single station.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Captures relationships between stations to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Based on Transformer-like architectures for seismic event forecasting.
- **Evaluated on Taiwan & Japan Datasets**: Demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods.
